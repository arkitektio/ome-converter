"""The app's logo, and one logo per action

The app's logo is a LOGO blok (an ``<AgentLogo>`` root): an SVG in colours of its own,
which a client shows beside the app's name. Each action's logo is an ACTION_LOGO blok
(an ``<ActionLogo>`` root): the same SVG shapes, but painted only with the viewer's palette (``ink``, ``muted``, ``brand``,
``brand-strong``, ``brand-soft``, ``surface``), so the actions of every app look like
one set and follow the viewer's brand and dark mode. A shape that ``animate``s plays
while the logo is hovered, and while the viewer's run of the action is going.

Every logo is drawn on a 24 x 24 grid to read at 16 px. Blok names are the
organization's, so each carries the app's name.
